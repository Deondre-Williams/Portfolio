            with him is when he told me, “No challenge is too big once you break it down step by step.” 
            Antone has always been a hardworking and supportive figure in my life, showing resilience in the face of difficulties 
            and leading by example. What makes him my hero is not just his success, but the way he encourages me to stay focused, 
            think critically, and never give up on my goals.

                    <p>Being a creative thinker and problem-solver allows me to approach my schoolwork with fresh ideas
                         and find effective solutions when challenges arise. My detail-oriented nature helps me stay organized
                          and produce high-quality work. Outside of academics, exploring new technologies and watching documentaries 
                          on innovation keep me inspired and broaden my knowledge, while photography encourages patience and attention 
                          to detail—all of which positively support my learning and growth in school. This is the reason I fine the

        <h3>Bussiness Idea</h3>
    

        <p>Automated inventory management is an AI-driven solution that revolutionizes how businesses handle 
            large-scale stock and supply chains. Unlike traditional rule-based automation, AI can manage 
            complex processes with multiple triggers, allowing systems to track demand, monitor stock levels, 
            automatically reorder supplies, predict seasonal fluctuations, and optimize delivery routes. 
            In my world, such a system could streamline operations in retail or technology projects by 
            reducing human error and ensuring resources are available when needed. Ethical considerations 
            include data privacy and the potential displacement of human workers, which can be mitigated by 
            implementing strict data policies and reskilling staff for higher-value tasks. An example of an actual 
            app in this area is <a href="https://tradegecko.com/">TradeGecko</a>, which provides AI-powered inventory solutions</p>
